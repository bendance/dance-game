So let's talk about the game

Here are some tasks for the first two hours:

- make the text box pretty X
- make it so I can't clip behind demon girl X
- fix issue with talking with bartender/raveguy X
- 

Known bugs: hard time talking to bartender because of collision, maybe edge collider takes priority over box?
