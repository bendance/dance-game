So let's talk about the game

Here are some tasks for the first two hours:

- make the text box pretty X
- make it so I can't clip behind demon girl X
- fix issue with talking with bartender/raveguy X
- pull your last commit and see if that has any artifacts X
- add sound to textbox functions X



Known bugs: hard time talking to bartender and raveboy because of collision, maybe edge collider takes priority over box? X
artificats come up when my player walks Seems like this bug only occurs in play mode due to strange, screen proportions (no biggie) X

Next time I want to add individual speech sounds for each person
