So let's talk about the game

Here are some tasks for the first two hours:

- make the text box pretty X
- make it so I can't clip behind demon girl X
- fix issue with talking with bartender/raveguy X
- pull your last commit and see if that has any artifacts

Known bugs: hard time talking to bartender and raveboy because of collision, maybe edge collider takes priority over box?
artificats come up when my player walks Seems like this bug only occurs in play mode due to strange, screen proportions (no biggie) X
