Notes for game on 11/13/2021

Hmmm... so what now?

I want it so that dialogue finishes when i press z again

So in undertale I'm not allowed the press z until the text finishes:

Here are my tasks for the day:

1.) Users can only leave text when it's finished displaying X

2.) Getting pixel perfect camera X

3.) Dialogue with each character X

4.) Player should not be able to walk while talking X

5.) Get rid of word clipping

6.) Speed up text while holding down "x"

7.) Make text box pretty

Known bugs: Issues with talking with bartender and raveguy, can clip behind demo girl

It takes 39 ms before reaching new line
