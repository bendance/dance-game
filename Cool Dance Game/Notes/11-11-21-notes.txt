So, I have the layers working, I should keep working on music.

Salesforce, Microsoft .NET, Sharepoint

Completed song, fix not being able to move

Fixed that, now how do I hide audio icon in game mode?

Loop doesn't sound very good, wrap the loop

I like the loop now, not bad

I want to find a way to create seamless loops in FL Studio, but the loop is okay for now

I. Okay, now it's time for dialogue

Can we get image to show as proportion of screen? Yes
Now text.



Notes:

Should I consider changing my camera to be more like Undertale?
Also, what does monobehavior do?
What is a singleton pattern?
